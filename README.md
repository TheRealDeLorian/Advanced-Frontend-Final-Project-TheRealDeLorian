# Final Project Proposal
1. Elevator pitch: Temple attendance tracker. It's like a journal for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to keep track of the temples they've attended.
2. Dorian Cottle is the only contributor
3. Features (rough list):
    - Track which temples you've been to and when
    - Upload selfies and keep journal entries of your visits
    - Set goals for temple attendance and receive reminders
4. Things I'll need to learn:
    - How to allow users to "download" the site like MySnow does
    - Browser notifications for web apps like this
    - How to ask for the user's location in React
